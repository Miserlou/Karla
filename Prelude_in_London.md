### Briefing
#### Top Floor the Circus

> Gentlemen. Please, take a seat. Some of you have been up here many times, but for others of you, this is your first time on the top floor. Welcome. 

> Let me get right to the point. We've had a tip passed over to us from Scotland Yard, of all places.. maybe they are good for something after all. Seems the drugs squad has seen an uptick in particularly strong heroin on the streets in the past six months. The proper stuff, right from godesses tit, or so I'm told. Shaking down the usual suspects turned up diddly, so they've been running an undercover in the Kray gang. Ronnie and Reggie, I'm sure you've seen them in the papers. Last night, they pulled the undercover's body out of the Thames. Throat cut. Back to square one for the Yardies.

> Funny thing, though. They pulled this out of his pocket.

Hand players clue one: Flight Receipt.

> Кабул в Москву, Москва в Берн, Берн в Лондон

> Scotland Yard didn't have a clue what to make of it, so they handed it over to us. I know your Russian isn't quite as good as it says your cirriculum vitae, so I've had Connie translate it for your convenience. It's a commercial cargo flight receipt: Kabul to Bern, Bern to London. Rugs, it says on the tin, but I doubt Ronnie Cray has too much use for a plane full of rugs. The signature has been torn off so we don't know who exactly received it, but looks like it landed last night. Heathrow has no record of it being picked up. Up and vanished.

> So, a shipment of pure Soviet heroin somewhere on the streets of London and dead police undercover, and I want you chaps to track down the heroin and find out what the connection to Russia is. If you can take down the crooks running the operation, all the better, but don't get yourselves killed doing Scotland Yard's job for them.

> Now, the other thing. As you might have heard in the hallways, one of best agents on the other side of the curtain was blown. Barely made it out alive. It seems, chaps, that our ship has sprung a leak. The only people - one of you is playing both sides. Keep an eye out for any funny business and report back to me with your findings once you've cleaned up the mess.

> We can't get near the Krays, but the birdies are chirping that the Krays have muscled out Charlie Richardson and his so called Torture Gang - a lovely lot, I'm sure - to take over everything south of river, East and West London under a single boss. The enemy of our enemy is our friend, as you all know by now, so go and see Charlie and see what you can find out on the Krays. I've put a thousand pounds in to your coffers, spend it wisely.

> Any questions?
